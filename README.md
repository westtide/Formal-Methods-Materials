# Formal Methods and Machine Learning

This repository contains a list of research links for the intersection
of Formal Methods and Machine Learning.

For applied machine learning for formal methods, some references to machine
learning for general software development are included as well,
which might be applicable for formal methods.
Analogously, articles concerning the verification of arbitrary (black-box)
systems are listed, which can be expanded onto machine learning systems.

The entries are (mostly) sorted by
publication year (descending),
first author (ascending), and
title (ascending).
